# Statistical_Trading
Contruction of so called "indicators", building and backtesting several trading strategies and analysis of trades with some of the tree algorithms and the logistical regression.
I'm a newbie to the automated trading and backtesting. Please don't hesitate to contact me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sercanbockun/) to share your insights, discuss new ideas,
to criticise my work and to take a look at the cleaner and the faster version of the codes.
